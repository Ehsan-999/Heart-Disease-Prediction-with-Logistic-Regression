## ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and ECG results.

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

### 📊 Project Workflow
- Load the heart disease dataset (`heart.csv`)
- Select relevant medical features
- Standardize features using `StandardScaler`
- Split data into training and test sets (80/20)
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate the model using **Jaccard Score** and **Classification Report**

### 🎯 Project Goal
To practice binary classification and apply logistic regression to a real-world medical dataset.
